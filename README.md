    <h1>Main Objectives Implemented During Hackathon</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Trained a machine learning model on a historical dataset of all places in India. By taking the user's live location, we provide a crime level indicator (green, yellow, red) to showcase their danger level.</li>
        <li>Displayed a heatmap where red indicates danger areas and green indicates safe areas.</li>
        <li>Showcased the latest women's crime news to inform users about recent incidents in their vicinity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Other Objectives</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Add an automatic voice recording feature when users enter a red danger level area, and send those recordings to selected close contacts to ensure their safety.</li>
    </ul>
